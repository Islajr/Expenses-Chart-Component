## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework
- [Chart.js](https://chartjs.org/) - Javascript Charts Library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I got really valuable hands-on experience with using the tailwindcss framework. I believe it is a very versatile
framework, and it is a really handy one to have.

### Continued development

I plan to work on more HTML and CSS Projects using the Tailwindcss and Bootstrap frameworks.
When I feel comfortable, I will dive into further projects on javascript.

### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS](https://www.tailwindcss.com) - This helped me a lot with my css. I wrote very, very little CSS and will use it going forward.
- [Chartjs](https://www.chartjs.com) - This is an amazing JS library which helped me lay out my graph. I'd recommend it to anyone who wishes to take on this project.
- [Traversy Media](https://www.traversymedia.com) - The owner of this website has been an amazing mentor for me in Web Development; I'd recommend his YouTube channel to anyone.
